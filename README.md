# OctoMouse

OctoMouse is a free and open-source application for MAC OSX that measures your mouse and keyboard activities.
It is developed using Xcode and Cocoa framework in Objective-C.

With OctoMouse, you will be able to always keep under your eyes how far did you travel with your mouse/trackpad, how many times did you press a key, how long did you use your computer and so on.

You can also check the [OctoMouse's official website](https://Takohi-Jona.github.io/OctoMouse).

# Privacy

As most of people, you are concerned about some privacy issues and this is why the application's source code is open. The application does not collect any private information from the user and does not use any network bandwith. It is not a keylogger and only keeps track of the number of times a key was pressed.
If you are still concerned about privacy, you can check the source code and build the application by yourself using Xcode.

# Q&A

## Why is the keystrokes counter not working?

For a security reason, OSX prevents any application to detect and retrieve all keyboard inputs that happen outside the application itself. If you want the keystrokes counter working, you will need to add OctoMouse in a whitelist. We can't force you to trust our application, but we assure you we don't collect any information from you.

To enable the key pressed counter feature, make sure this application is added and checked in: _System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility_. You might need to restart the application.

# Teach yourself!
Use the source code to learn more about OSX, Cocoa and Objective-C development.
The application's source code will show you how to:
* show an icon in the status bar;
* display and hide a panel when clicking on the icon;
* register to some events inside or outside the application (keypress, mouse click...);
* start the application at login;
* save user's preferences.
